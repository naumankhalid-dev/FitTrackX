## Database Design & DBHelper Usage

The appâ€™s database is managed through a custom `DBHelper` class, extending `SQLiteOpenHelper`, responsible for all data-related operations:

### Key Tables & Relationships

| Table      | Description                            | Key Fields                         |
|------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Users**  | Stores user credentials and profile | `user_id (PK)`, `username`, `password`, `email` |
| **Routines** | User-specific workout plans         | `routine_id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `name`, `description` |
| **Workouts** | Logged exercises and details        | `workout_id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `routine_id (FK)`, `date`, `duration`, `calories` |
| **Goals**   | Fitness targets                     | `goal_id (PK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `goal_type`, `target_value`, `current_value`, `deadline` |

### DBHelper Responsibilities

- **Database Creation and Upgrades:**  
  Creates all necessary tables with foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. Manages smooth schema upgrades.

- **CRUD Operations:**  
  Implements methods to add, retrieve, update, and delete users, routines, workouts, and goals, ensuring secure and efficient data handling.

- **User Authentication:**  
  Validates user credentials and maintains session information.

- **Efficient Data Queries:**  
  Supports complex queries for workout history, goal progress, and analytics to feed the charting components.

- **Transaction Management:**  
  Uses transactions where needed to preserve data consistency during multiple related database operations.

- **Data Integrity and Security:**  
  Enforces constraints and handles exceptions to maintain robust database health.
